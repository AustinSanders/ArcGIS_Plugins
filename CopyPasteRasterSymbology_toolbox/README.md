Update: Nov 14, 2014 - check for layer names with spaces

Desc: The toolbox simply allows one to copy the symbology from one layer and
   paste (apply) it to one or more ArcMap layers. Works on rasters and feature
   layers. For example, it is good for setting a single raster with the outside
   collar (usually 0) and then applying this to many layers.

    This is essentially an alternative to running the built-in ArcMap tool
    "Apply Symbology From Layer" in batch.

install: Run from this unzipped directory in ArcCatalog or copy and paste this
         toolbox into your favorites.

To use:
(1) select one layer to copy symbology from. Use only layers in pulldown menu.

(2) add one or more layers into the "Output" area. For many images, simply drag them
from ArcMap's Table of Contentc (TOC) into the output multi-list area.
